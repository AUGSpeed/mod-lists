Better graphics, tons of new weapons and armor, plenty of extra content, and improved combat mechanics that provide a challenge without being overly frustrating.

#### **_Requirements Before Installing:_**

  *Current build version of Wabbajack. This can be found on the Wabbajack Discord linked above.
  *Clean install of Fallout 4, without HD DLC.
  *Nexus Premium.
  *108 gigs of free space. Note that this number does NOT include your Fallout 4 installation.

#### **_Installation Instructions:_**

2. Create a new folder at the root of a drive (Example: D:\Wabbajack).
3. Place the Wabbajack.exe into this new folder.
4. Download the newest BananaSplit v2.4.wabbajack file from the Wabbajack Discord, or install directly from the Wabbajack User Interface.
5. Place the modlist file into the Wabbajack folder, next to the Wabbajack.exe file. Skip this step if installing directly from the Wabbajack User Interface.

**Basic Tab:**  
  Choose the resolution that matches your PC.  
  Make sure that Windowed Mode, Borderless, VSync, Enable File Selection, Load Loose Files, and Recommended Tweaks are all checked.  
  Click the Default preset, then choose either Low, Medium, or High, depending on your PC. Do not use the Ultra setting.  
  Note that Recommended Tweaks will uncheck itself during this process. That's ok, we got what we needed from it.

**Gameplay Tab:**  
  Check Always Run by Default. Uncheck anything else.  
  Change Over-Encumbered Reminder to 3600.  
  Note: Sprint Fix may allow you to run into cells that haven't been fully loaded yet. If this doesn't bother you, or if the game keeps forcing you to stop sprinting, you can enable this option.

  Save and Exit.  

That’s it! Launch ModOrganizer2.exe from the Banana Split installation folder. Make sure the “**F4SE**” option is selected in Mod Organizer 2, then click **Run**. This is the only way we will launch Fallout 4 from now on.

#### MCM Settings:
*_Note: Anything involving hotkeys can be set up however you like. These are simply the way I have them set up for myself._

iHud Settings, Pt. 1. - if you want your HUD or Compass visible at all times, set a hotkey for it that you'll never use (like semicolon or something). Then exit the menu and press the key once to toggle the HUD/compass. Now it'll never go away.

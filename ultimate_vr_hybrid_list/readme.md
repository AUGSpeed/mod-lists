## IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING USSEP 4.1.2a

Due to compliance to the new Wabbajack Whitelisting Rules
The Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch 4.1.2a is no longer included in this Automated Modlist via download or binary patch. It is however **HIGHLY** recommended that you find a backed up version of 4.1.2a to overwrite the included 4.2.0 version with to ensure full SkyrimVR compatibility.

### Prep Work

* You **DO NOT** need to have MO2 Pre-installed, Wabbajack will do this
* You **MUST** have a Premium Nexus membership for Wabbajack to function
* Make sure you have a `.rar` and `.7z` extractor such as [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) that can extract both file types.
* [Join the Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/fS8ADEg)
  * You must accept the Discord agreement in `#welcome` to access the official discussion and release channels for this modlist
  * Goto [Github](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases/tag/0.9.5) to obtain the currently supported version of `Wabbajack.exe`
  * Also choose and accept the `Skyrim SE` role to access the `#ultimate-vr-hybrid` release and support chats
* Install Skyrim VR
* Create an Empty Folder on the root of the same drive you installed Skyrim VR on
  * Example `C:/Skyrim VR MO2/`
  * Make sure the drive has at least **95GB** free for the MO2 setup
  * Additionally you may want to create a `MO2 VR Downloads` folder on another drive (like a storage HDD) if your main game drive is an SSD. That drive needs at least 55GB free.
  * If both the Install and Downloads folder share a drive, you need at least 150 GB free in total.
* Extract the contents of the `The Ultimate VR Hybrid List - ####.7z` there
  * This is where you will point the Wabbajack Installer’s “Installation Location”
  * So for example your `C:/Skyrim VR MO2/` directory should **ONLY** contain:
    * `Wabbajack.exe`
    * `The Ultimate VR Hybrid List - ####.modlist_v2`
    * (optionally) a `/downloads/` folder
* Clear out remnants of a previous **NON PORTABLE** Mod Organizer 2 Install
  * Delete `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\LOOT`
  * Delete `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Skyrim Special Edition`
  * Delete `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\zEdit`
  * Delete `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Mod Organizer`

### Installation

1. Launch Skyrim VR at least once before attempting to play a modded version
Once loaded into Skyrim VR open the menu and go to System > Settings > VR Performance and adjust the following settings to match:

#### VR Performance

* Disable Dynamic Resolution
* Disable Foliage Shadows
* Set the Supersampling slider to all the way to the left
* Make sure BOTH `Disable LOD` options are UNCHECKED
* Set the `Tree Lod` slider all the way to the right
* Set the Distance sliders for Items & Actors to About 1/5th to the right
* Set the Distance sliders for Objects Half-Way to the right
* Set the Distance sliders for Grass all the way to the right (adjust to the left as needed if you have framerate problems)

#### VR

* Adjust `FOV Filter while Turning` and `FOV Filter while Moving` to your personal taste
(It applies black vignettes to the borders of your view to combat motion sickness)
* Activate Realistic Bow Aiming
* Disable Physical Sneak (This is handled by the “Auto Sneak & Jump VR” mod)
* Disable Realistic Swimming

All other needed ini tweaks are pre-applied in the included MO2 local ini settings, so no other tweaking should be needed.

2. Goto your SkyrimVR install folder, find the file named `binkw64.dll` and rename it to `binkw64_.dll`
If you forget to do this than SkyrimVR **WILL NOT BOOT** once you copy over the game folder specific files generated by Wabbajack

3. Run the Latest `Wabbajack.exe` from the `#builds` chat in the Discord.
    * Select the `Ultimate VR Hybrid List - ####.modlist_v2` file you previously downloaded and start the installation.
    * **YOUR INSTALL DIRECTORY MUST BE ON THE SAME PHYSICAL DRIVE AS YOUR SKYRIM VR INSTALL. IT WILL NOT BOOT OTHERWISE.**
    * Your chosen `Downloads` folder can be located anywhere.
    * If the log window indicates a file is `Unable to Download`, click `Begin` again and it will pick up the missing file. The official Nexus API that Wabbajack utilizes limits download requests to only 100 downloads every hour, so if this happens just close the `Wabbajack.exe` program and start it up again later, it will pick up where it left off.

**IF YOU GET THIS ERROR YOU MUST MANUALLY DOWNLOAD Interesting NPCs 3.42.7z**

![alt](https://i.ibb.co/y6XZqvp/unnamed.png)

The Download Link is `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QxugzSXxVA7p5R0dCcxIQTnP5pozlrzM`
Place this file in your chosen `Downloads` folder, overwrite if asked then run Wabbajack again to continue the install.

4. Run `ModOrganizer.exe` that Wabbajack installed in your Skyrim VR MO2 folder. You may want to make a shortcut for MO2 on your desktop or start menu.
When opening for the first time, choose `Portable Mode` if it asks, then Close Mod Organizer after it fully loads.
5. Copy the contents of the `Game Folder Files` directory that Wabbajack created into your SkyrimVR install folder. Overwrite if asked, **BUT MAKE SURE YOU DID STEP 2 FIRST!**
6. Find a backed up copy of USSEP 4.1.2a
     * (The **EXACT** file name should be `Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch-266-4-1-2a.7z`)
     * Place it in your chosen downloads folder then open MO2 again and goto the `Downloads` tab on the right pane of MO2.
     * Right Click on the archive file and choose `Query Info` if it has a Red Exclamation Point next to it, then Double click the file and make sure to set the install name as
`OVERWRITE WITH 4.1.2a - Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch - OVERWRITE WITH 4.1.2a`
     * Copy and paste this if needed.
     * When asked how you would like to handle the install choose the `Replace` option.
When a `Extract BSA` window pops up, Click `No`.
7. In the right pane of MO2 search for `Alternate Start` in the filter search box.
     * Right Click on the archive file and choose `Query Info` if it has a Red Exclamation Point next to it.
     * In the left pane of MO2 search for `Alternate Start` in the filter search box.
     * Right click on `REINSTALL & BSA EXTRACT - Alternate Start - Live Another Life`
     * Choose `Reinstall Mod`, then Click `OK`, then Click `Replace`.
     * When a `Extract BSA` window pops up, Click `Yes`, then Close MO2.
     * **IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS STEP SKYRIM VR WILL CRASH OR HAVE AN INFINITE LOADING SCREEN WHEN YOU ATTEMPT TO START A NEW GAME**
8. `The Ultimate VR Hybrid List` comes with the LCD version of `High Fidelity ENB` pre-configured:
    * If you have an OLED VR Headset then goto `https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27308?tab=files`
    * Manually download the `OLED` version and overwrite the files in your SkyrimVR install folder that you previously copied over in Step 5.
    * If you do not want to use an ENB, delete `d3d11.dll`, `d3dcompiler_46e.dll`, `enblocal.ini`, `enbseries.ini`, & the `enbseries` folder.
9. Start up SteamVR and get into either your SteamVR Home or your blank loading environment.
10. Run `ModOrganizer.exe` again, selecting SKSE from the dropdown list of options on the top right and click run.
The first start up may take a little while if your using the included ENB, it needs to build it's shader cache and create the `enbcache` folder.
11. Start a "New Game" and load into the "Live Another Life" prison cell and design your character.
Once you've finalized things and chosen your name you will start seeing MCM "loading" messages on the top left of your FoV.
Wait till all of these messages stop appearing, then open your system menu.

**Vanilla Sprinkles Readme**

**What I want from this list**


When I first started playing Fallout 4 many years ago, I realized that there were many issues with this game, both with low quality textures, and that there were some quality of life things that I felt were missing. With the creation of the Wabbajack installer, I decided to create a list of mods I thought would solve most of these issues, so others could use it as a base to build their own mod lists off of!



**What Vanilla Sprinkles IS: 
Major texture upgrades as well as quality of life improvements and bug fixes

**What Vanilla Sprinkles ISN'T:
Major game play overhauls or changes that affect storyline


Because of this, there will be no armor or weapon mods added to the list.


**Requirements:
All Fallout 4 DLCs (Excluding the HD DLC) - This can not be avoided
A Clean Fallout 4 Installation - This means no mods in your game folder AT ALL.
About 50 GB of free space to download and install the mods
Premium Nexus subscription. Wabbajack uses the Nexus API, which requires a premium account in order to utilize.

Here are the instructions on how to install this list (Courtesy of the Wabbajack Team):


1. Start with a clean installation of your chosen game. This means installed in a Steam library outside of "C:\Program Files" https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7418-YUBN-8129. Set any pre-existing installation of MO2 to 'Portable' mode.
2. Create an install folder and a downloads folder for your new Modlist. These should be low level folders i.e. "C:\ModListName" and "C:\ModlistName Download" and not be inside any user folder (Documents, Desktop etc.). Do not set these to an existing MO2 installation, use a new/empty folder.
3. Download Wabbajack from Discord/Nexus.
4. Run Wabbajack and select “Install a Modlist”(edited)
5. In the file explorer that opens, browse to the .modlist file you downloaded and open it.
6. In the lower left quarter of the window, set the “MO2 Profile” field to your chosen installation folder (it will default to where Wabbajack is located) and the “Download Location” field to your new downloads folder. This will default to “downloadlocation”/MO2/downloads.
7. Click Begin to start installation. After a moment your web browser will open and you will be prompted for SSO authorization on the Nexus. Once confirmed, the files will begin downloading before being installed.8) After installation has completed, copy the contents of the "Game Folder Files" to your game root directory i.e. "\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Fallout 4"
9. After installation has completed, run Mod Organizer 2.exe, if prompted select Portable and your game type.
